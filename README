On installation of new Ubuntu Server, plug the machine into ethernet, and run this command

sudo ifup p3p1 
sudo dhclient -v p3p1

Alternatively, follow the instructions in the wireless folder

Then run this command to proceed with the install:

wget -O - http://raw.github.com/comtesacristain/linux-setup/master/install.sh | bash

This should then install your standard desired Linux install.
